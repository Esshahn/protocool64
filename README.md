# protocool64
JavaScript prototyping tool for creating C64 code.

Q: WHAAAAT??? I can now create C64 games and demos in JavaScript???!!1

A: No. This is just a simple idea I had for a while. With protocool64, I can simulate (as in "fake") a C64 in the browser. This is no emulation, but just visually looking like a C64.

Q: That sounds super disappointing. 

A: Yes!

Q: But... why.

A: I can use this setup to sketch game or demo ideas I have without going all the way in 6502 assembly. It's saves time and is less frustrating. Also I'm adding some helper tools (e.g. table data generators) that further support my C64 development.

Q: okthxbye

A: goodbye sir. Or mam.
